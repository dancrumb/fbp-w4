# Flow Based Programming - W4

This is a _very_ rudimentary and exploratory attempt at Flow Based Programming.

This network calculates (with a bunch of caveats) the amount
of Witholding recommended by the IRS W4 form.

## Setup

Just run `npm install`

You do not need to have `noflo` globally installed.

## Running

Just run `npm run w4`.
